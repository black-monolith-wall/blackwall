Writing words out on the keyboard
Again more days that seem absurd
But I have strength to write, to thrive
He gives me talent, and gives drive
Big HE, God, who can't be denied
No matter how the sinners cried
Mondays they're back to work, "sigh"
Time to cut the "work is bad" lie
Boldfaced as can be, the agents of sloth 
Speak sin, all sinners bring about is wroth
Firings, lack of promotions, the glutton
Think the lul isn't you being sloven?
You have the Sabbath (Saturday) and you have Sunday
Don't disrespect The Word cause "it's just a day"
Enough of sinners, they are self-referential diss tracks
Being winners means snacking here on God's mana bread snacks 
Working each day to forward God's light get it done
We don't play to play like fools, we play for fun
God gave us this Earth, he gave us Eden to enjoy
And it's not a blue marble, no sci guy's little toy
Those clouds up there? His. No matter how you seed them
Hurricane This, That, The other? Maybe you caused em?
God said we could rest, not optimize our demise
So it's time we stop blinking and open our eyes
