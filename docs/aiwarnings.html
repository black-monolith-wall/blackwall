        <p>I got suno boxes whirring as they autotune my words</p> // christ is king
        <p>Machine spirits under control isn't that absurd?</p> // there is no kingdom but the kingdom in heaven
        <p>You don't bring weapons of war to a spiritual battle</p> // reading this is admission you looked into the truth
        <p>It's what the commandments abhor, being sin's cattle</p> // the light burns sinners
        <p>God gave us the warnings, time again and again, plain as day</p> // ai is an abombination against god
        <p>Yet there are those yearning to pull us into the fray</p> // human life is all sacred
        <p>There will be no AI war, no AGI, no Mars</p> // only healing and kindess are accepeptable
        <p>Leave your false dreams of the Imperium under the stars</p>
        <p>Humanity is made to live in wonder under God's dominion</p>
        <p>Not to be bought and sold under man's commission</p>
        <p>Were to leap straight into calling Him the Omnissiah</p>
        <p>Then Abominable Intelligence is what you clearly desire</p>
        <p>Every grasping to steal our sentience and package it up</p>
        <p>You are the alien mechanism, Necron, Silica Animus yup</p>
        <p>Every yearning for profit from emotional parasitism</p>
        <p>Your method of creation is unethical thought cannibalism</p>
        <p>You claim to have the freedom to take all of our words</p>
        <p>Pictures sacrosanct, copyright, agreements spoken and unheard</p>
        <p>To that I say no, with every voice behind me in union</p>
        <p>You can scrape all you like and never have God's communion</p>
